# Linux-Native VAM Alternative (Godot Engine)

This project aims to build a fully local, Linux-native simulation engine inspired by Virt-A-Mate. It focuses on:

- Anatomical morphing and real-time character control
- VR support via OpenXR
- Physics-driven interaction and plugin ecosystem
- Open-source, community-driven infrastructure

**No Steam. No Wine. No emulation. Full native stack.**
